    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does It Mean for a Card to Be “Banked”?</h2>
      <p>Business credit cards do not exist in isolation. They are always anchored to one or more bank accounts, which are used to receive settlements, pay statements or guarantee credit lines.</p>
      <p>Depending on the setup, a card program might settle via:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Direct debit from a primary business account</li>
        <li>Manual bank transfer initiated by the company</li>
        <li>Automatic sweep from a designated settlement account</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The chosen method affects cash flow, operational workload and how easily finance teams can reconcile activity.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>From Card Balance to Bank Account Movement</h2>
      <p>As cardholders spend, transactions accumulate on the card account. These flows are separate from the company’s main bank ledger until the statement is generated and paid.</p>
      <p>A typical sequence looks like this:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Cardholders make purchases on business or B2B cards.</li>
        <li>Transactions are authorized and later settled to merchants via the card network.</li>
        <li>The issuer tracks all transactions on a dedicated card account.</li>
        <li>At statement date, the issuer calculates the balance due.</li>
        <li>Payment is made from a business bank account, either by direct debit or bank transfer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The timing of this last step — paying the statement — is where card usage links directly into the company’s banking and cash management.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Direct Debits, Transfers and Cash-Flow Planning</h2>
      <p>Many card programs rely on direct debit. The issuer pulls the due amount from a nominated bank account on a specified date. This can simplify operations but requires predictable cash balances on the account being debited.</p>
      <p>Other setups use manual transfers, where finance teams schedule payments from treasury or operating accounts. This offers more fine-grained control but adds workload and the risk of missed or late payments if processes fail.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Multiple Accounts, Currencies and Entities</h2>
      <p>Some businesses maintain separate bank accounts by country, currency or legal entity. Card programs may either:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Use a single central account for all card spend, or</li>
        <li>Segment settlement by region, entity or currency.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The chosen structure influences FX exposure, internal transfers and how quickly local teams see the impact of card spend on their own bank balances.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Reconciliation Between Card Statements and Bank Feeds</h2>
      <p>For finance teams, the key task is matching outgoing bank movements to card statements and underlying expenses. This typically involves:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Aligning statement dates with accounting periods</li>
        <li>Matching direct debits or transfers to card program balances</li>
        <li>Ensuring all card transactions are coded and approved before payment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Good integrations between card platforms, banking portals and accounting systems can reduce manual work, but they still depend on clear internal responsibilities.</p>
