        <p class="hero-lead">
          Being “banked” usually means having an active relationship with a bank or similar institution: an account, salary deposits and basic services. Here we look at how that status interacts with credit-card approvals, limits, fees and repayment tools.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does “Banked” Mean?</h2>
      <p>In everyday language, a person is <strong>banked</strong> if they have access to formal financial services: a bank account, debit card, sometimes online banking and direct deposits. The opposite is being unbanked or underbanked – relying mainly on cash, prepaid products or non-bank lenders.</p>
      <p>Credit cards sit on top of this foundation. Issuers often prefer applicants who already have a stable banking footprint: a checking account, regular income flows and a history of using basic products without issues.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Why it matters -->
    <section id="why-it-matters" class="section">
      <h2>Why Being Banked Matters for Credit Cards</h2>
      <p>When assessing a credit-card application, issuers care about <strong>risk and stability</strong>. Being banked can help with both:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Identity &amp; KYC:</strong> Existing bank relationships make it easier to verify identity and comply with “know your customer” rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Income patterns:</strong> Regular deposits into an account help lenders understand income stability and cash-flow patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment methods:</strong> Direct debit from a bank account can reduce missed payments and operational risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-product view:</strong> If the same group offers both accounts and cards, they can see how other products have been handled over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For underbanked users, issuers may rely more heavily on credit reports, alternative data or require products like <strong>secured cards</strong> or lower starting limits.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Scenarios -->
    <section id="scenarios" class="section">
      <h2>Typical “Banked” vs. “Underbanked” Card Scenarios</h2>
      <p>Real life is more nuanced than a simple yes/no label. People move between banked, underbanked and fully excluded over time. Here are some example patterns:</p>
      <div class="table-wrap">
        <table class="table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Profile</th>
              <th>Bank Relationship</th>
              <th>Card Options Often Seen</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Stable salary + main account</td>
              <td>Salary paid into a checking account, regular bill payments.</td>
              <td>Standard unsecured cards, possible upgrades to rewards or premium products over time.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>New to banking</td>
              <td>Account recently opened, limited history, maybe moving from cash-based finances.</td>
              <td>Entry-level or student cards, low limits, sometimes secured or co-signed options.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Underbanked</td>
              <td>Irregular deposits, mainly prepaid or cash, limited use of traditional accounts.</td>
              <td>Prepaid cards, secured cards, or specialist credit-builder products with guardrails.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Previously overdrawn or in collections</td>
              <td>History of overdrafts, late payments or charged-off accounts.</td>
              <td>Rebuild-focused products: secured cards, strict limits and higher monitoring.</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

    <!-- Behaviour & repayments -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How Bank Accounts and Repayments Connect</h2>
      <p>For most people, <strong>the same bank account</strong> is used to pay rent or mortgage, everyday expenses – and the credit-card bill. This connection matters:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
        <li>Setting up <strong>automatic payments</strong> from a bank account can reduce missed due dates.</li>
        <li>Keeping a small buffer in the account can help absorb unexpected card transactions or delayed refunds.</li>
        <li>Some banks offer tools inside their app to split payments, create instalment plans or receive alerts when spending spikes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For underbanked consumers who rely on cash or prepaid cards, the repayment flow can be more manual and error-prone, increasing the chance of late fees or interest charges.</p>

    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does It Mean for a Card to Be “Banked”?</h2>
      <p>Business credit cards do not exist in isolation. They are always anchored to one or more bank accounts, which are used to receive settlements, pay statements or guarantee credit lines.</p>
      <p>Depending on the setup, a card program might settle via:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Direct debit from a primary business account</li>
        <li>Manual bank transfer initiated by the company</li>
        <li>Automatic sweep from a designated settlement account</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The chosen method affects cash flow, operational workload and how easily finance teams can reconcile activity.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>From Card Balance to Bank Account Movement</h2>
      <p>As cardholders spend, transactions accumulate on the card account. These flows are separate from the company’s main bank ledger until the statement is generated and paid.</p>
      <p>A typical sequence looks like this:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Cardholders make purchases on business or B2B cards.</li>
        <li>Transactions are authorized and later settled to merchants via the card network.</li>
        <li>The issuer tracks all transactions on a dedicated card account.</li>
        <li>At statement date, the issuer calculates the balance due.</li>
        <li>Payment is made from a business bank account, either by direct debit or bank transfer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The timing of this last step — paying the statement — is where card usage links directly into the company’s banking and cash management.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Direct Debits, Transfers and Cash-Flow Planning</h2>
      <p>Many card programs rely on direct debit. The issuer pulls the due amount from a nominated bank account on a specified date. This can simplify operations but requires predictable cash balances on the account being debited.</p>
      <p>Other setups use manual transfers, where finance teams schedule payments from treasury or operating accounts. This offers more fine-grained control but adds workload and the risk of missed or late payments if processes fail.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Multiple Accounts, Currencies and Entities</h2>
      <p>Some businesses maintain separate bank accounts by country, currency or legal entity. Card programs may either:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Use a single central account for all card spend, or</li>
        <li>Segment settlement by region, entity or currency.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The chosen structure influences FX exposure, internal transfers and how quickly local teams see the impact of card spend on their own bank balances.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Reconciliation Between Card Statements and Bank Feeds</h2>
      <p>For finance teams, the key task is matching outgoing bank movements to card statements and underlying expenses. This typically involves:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Aligning statement dates with accounting periods</li>
        <li>Matching direct debits or transfers to card program balances</li>
        <li>Ensuring all card transactions are coded and approved before payment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Good integrations between card platforms, banking portals and accounting systems can reduce manual work, but they still depend on clear internal responsibilities.</p>
